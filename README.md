## IBM Watson Speech-to-Text Head-to-Head Comparison

This is a quick-and-dirty, POC-quality utility for comparing the transcription results of IBM Watson Speech-to-Text to 1.) the manually generated ground truth, and 2.) A competitor speech-to-text service.

It uses the IBM Watson SDK and [jsdifflib](https://github.com/cemerick/jsdifflib) to generate a HTML report that shows the side-by-side accuracy and visualization of the transcript word-by-word comparisons.
